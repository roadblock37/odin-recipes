    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An easy recipe made with both fresh strawberries and canned strawberry pie filling. The cream cheese gives it a bit of a tang and the crumble reminds me of a sugar cookie.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh strawberries, diced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup butteer, melted</li>
            <li>1 (21 ounce) can strawberry pie filling</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch dish with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle strawberries with sugar and let rest until strawberries release their juices, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whip cream cheese until light and fluffy. Add strawberries to whipped cream cheese and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Combine cake mix and melted butter in a separate bowl and mix until mixture comes together as a crumble.</li>
            <li>Pour pie filling into the greased baking dish. Pour strawberry-cream cheese mixture on top. Evenly distribute crumble over pie filling.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
